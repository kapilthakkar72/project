Matlab code for Random Walk Anomaly Detection
=============================================

Author: Haibin Cheng

The following Matlab code (getanomaly.m) computes the anomaly score of a time 
series using 2 approaches: moving average or random walk. Details of the 
algorithm can be found in the following two references:

The getanomaly function takes 2 input: data and threshold. Details of the
function are given below.

The anomaly detection function can be invoked the following way:

   matlab> [indcnt,score] = getanomaly(data,thres);

where: 

data is a row vector that represents a time series
thres is a threshold vector:
score returns the anomaly score for each point in the time series
indcnt retuns the start point and duration of the detected anomaly

The threshold vector can be set as follows:

thres = [-1.4 12 1 1 60 2 1 1];  to compute anomaly detection using moving average approach
thres  = [-1.4 6 1 1 60 2 1 2];  to compute anomaly detection using random walk approach

thres(1) = threshold, blow the value is claimed as anomaly
thres(2) = mvd, minimum duration to define an anomaly, for example,
           an anomaly can be defined as 12 consecutive months of abnormally
           low values (for moving average) or 6 consecutive months low values
           (for random walk)
thres(6) = 2 --- detrend the time series, otherwise no detrending
thres(8) = method (1-- moving average, 2--random walk)

The remaining entries in the threshold vector can be set arbitrarily (they were  
used for setting thresholds in a Matlab event visualization tool).

thres(3) = Land Variable, FPAR for 1 (for disturbance event detection)
thres(4) = start Index 1 for start of 5 years
thres(5) = end Index 60 for end of 5 years
thres(7) = Continent Index
