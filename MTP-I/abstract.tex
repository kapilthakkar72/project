Supply demand imbalance, natural calamities etc. may not always be the reason behind the rise in the price of a commodity. It may be a result of artificial supply deficit planned intelligently by tradersâ€™ nexus to earn more profits through manipulation of supply of commodity and hence indirectly controlling their prices. Our attempt is to locate such hikes in prices which seem suspicious (we call them anomalies). We try to detect these anomalies by characterizing them and forming hypothesis based on their characteristics and then algorithmically try to find the
days in time series during which it violates the stated hypothesis.
