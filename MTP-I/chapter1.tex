\chapter{Introduction}


\section{Motivation}

Supply demand imbalance, natural calamities etc. may not always be the reason behind the rise in the price of a commodity. ​It may be a consequence of artificial supply deficit planned intelligently by traders’ nexus for profiteering through manipulation of supply of commodity and hence indirectly controlling their prices. ​Our attempt is to locate such hikes in prices which seem suspicious (we call them anomalies).​ To detect and analyse the characteristics of anomalies in the prices of commodities. Currently we have considered the case of onion and based on that we are looking forward to develop library for any time-series.


\section{Objective}

Our objective is to create library with some set of functionalities to detect anomalies in the give input time series​. Anomalies will be based on the hypothesis stated by the user​. For particular scenario stated by user, execute appropriate algorithms and report the anomalies in the time series.


\section{Relavence of Project}

Anomaly detection techniques helps to explore many areas which are explained in detail in next chapter. If anomaly can not be justified by any natural parameter than it stats some serious issue. It states that something is wrong in the process and draws attention towards it. For example, unnecessary hike in the prices may be due to bad government policies, loopwholes in the system of commodity, etc. So our project will help journalist or end user interested in detecting abnormal behavior with the heklp of some hypothesis.
